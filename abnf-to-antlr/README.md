# ABNF TO ANTL

**you should probably be looking for files in ../output-xxx**

**You don't need to read this unless you need to change sdp.anbf, which requires regenerating sdp.m4**

**If you do update or change sdp.abnf, then you need to read further**


The SDP format described in the IETF RFCs for SIP, WebRTC, etc is described in a number of different RFCs,
which each include chunks of ABNF, a language for describing protocols and computer languages.

But, the popular Antlr compiler generator tool does not take ABNF, 
but a different syntax: m4

Luckily, there is an open source tool to convert abnf to m4.

This is how we convert the abnf to Antlr g4 format.

You have your choice of Linux or Windows scripts:


1. Under Linux, see linux.sh   was written for Ubuntu 18.04
2. Under Windows, see windows-abnf-to-antlr.bat
